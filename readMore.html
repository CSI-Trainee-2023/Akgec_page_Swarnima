        The college has set up India’s first Industrial Robotic Training Centre in collaboration with Kuka Robotics of Germany. The centre is equipped with standard training cell comprising of KUKA KR-16 Industrial Robot with required auxiliary equipment and KUKA KR-5 Arc Welding Robot with MIG welding equipment and torch. In addition to this, the centre offers expert level trainings in various state-of-the-art robotic applications including Robo milling, Robotic CMT, Robotic time twin welding, Robotic ultrasonic welding, Robotic vision system and spot welding etc. The centre also has a Robotics Computer Simulation Lab with software like Sim Pro and Sim Layout used to design, develop and simulate robotic operations for different industrial applications. The centre provides internationally recognized certification for its Basic, Advanced and Expert level training programs in this emerging technological area.
        The College has established the first NI LabVIEW Academy in the state of U.P. in collaboration with National Instruments. The Academy is equipped with Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workband (LabVIEW) with built in functionality for simulation, data acquisition, instrument control, measurement analysis, data presentation and state-of-the-art Education Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Suite (ELVIS) for training on concepts of Sensorics, Mechatronics and Controls. The Academy offers courses which provide opportunity to obtain three-part NI LabVIEW certification, namely CLAD, CLD & CLA, that imparts broad working knowledge of the LabVIEW environment. Till now Labview Academy has conducted more than 36 training courses and trained nearly 600+ engineers. The Academy has also achieved international recognized 215 CLAD Certification (out of 1900 in the country) and 18 CLD certifications (out of 241 in the country). To recognize the spectacular outcomes consistently since last three years, the academy has been selected as “Best LabVIEW Academy in India” amongest 93 academies in India. This award was given during ‘NI days 2016” conference held on 19th October, 2016 at Bangalore.
        
        The College has also set up the first Centre of Competence in Automation Technologies in North India in collaboration with BOSCH Rexroth AG, Germany.
